**Description**

This is a portfolio website I have built using bootstrap components and customising them with my own CSS styles.  It has been designed to meet the following acceptance criteria - 

The website should include the following bootstrap components:

    - A Navigation bar
    
    - A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.

      - Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
  
        - Links should navigate to the appropriate sections 

    - A hero section

        - A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

    - A work section

      - A section displaying your work in grid. 

        - If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/ 

      - Use bootstrap cards for each project.

        - The description should give a brief overview of the work.

      - Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

    - A skills section

      - List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

    - An about / contact section.

      - An "About Me" section in the same row.
    
    - A footer section.

      - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

      - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

I decided to follow a monochromatic vintage theme and whilst this is a good start, I think the design could be developed further.

The finished page looks like this -
